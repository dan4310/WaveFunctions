# WaveFunctions

My graph application that plots your wave functions.

This allows the user to plot cosine and sine functions with different input parameters. Fill out all fields for a given
function and then press the plot button. If you want to superimpose the waves, check the interference box before pressing plot.
Press the clear button to clear all fields.

- The fields can handle both integers and decimals
